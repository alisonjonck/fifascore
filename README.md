# Starting the development server
- Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and type `npm start` to start the local development server of Expo CLI.
- Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI.

# Opening the app on your phone/tablet
- On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
- On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Projects" tab of the Expo client app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal or in Expo Dev Tools.
